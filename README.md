<h1>Cult Classics Movie Quiz</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Cult Classic Movie Quiz Application. This project was my 3rd mile stone project through the code institute</p>
<p> For this project we were tasked to create a quiz game using flask, python and a variety of front end skill we had previously learnt</p>
<p> I have used a start bootstrap theme as a basis for the layout of the website and then adapted it appropriately to suit the application</p>
<p> I used bootstrap and media queries to make the design as responsive to the user as possible </p>
<p> I have deployed the application on several different browsers and devises to check all is ok.</p>
<h3> The following steps were taken to build this application</h3>
<ul>
<li> Installed Flask framework using 'sudo pip3 install Flask'</li>
<li> Created 'run.py', main python file</li>
<li> from flask import Flask, redirect, render_template, request, url_for </li>
<li> created requirements.txt file using 'pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt'</li>
